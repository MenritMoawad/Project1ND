## Instructions

<!-- The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file. -->

This project is focusing on manipulating the HTML and CSS content using JavaScript. 

## Details:

1. A nav menu bar is added using JS according to the number of sections that exist on the web page. 
2. Each item in the nav menu is linked to the corresponding section. 
3. Last thing added is the event listeners where each item is clickable and it navigates to the corresponding section.
